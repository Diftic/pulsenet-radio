# PulseNet Player — TODO

---

## Done ✓

- [x] Replace `Assets/icon.ico` with Pulsenet branding (multi-res .ico from PulseNetIcon 1024x1024.png)
- [x] Replace splash screen logo with Pulsenet branding (`main_logo.png`)
- [x] Replace idle video logo with Pulsenet branding (`main_logo.png` 812×433)
- [x] Wire real Pulsenet channel ID (`UCIMaIJsfJEMi5yJIe5nAb0g`)
- [x] Rebuild drag system — JS-initiated via `startDrag`, whole frame draggable except buttons/video/settings
- [x] Zoom resizes window (not CSS zoom) — no blink, correct hit areas
- [x] Zoom slider replaced with -10%/input/+10% buttons
- [x] Settings panel doubled in size
- [x] Window position persists between open/close
- [x] Scroll wheel only captured when cursor is over overlay
- [x] Frame width trimmed to 1202px (28px each side) to better fit frame_base.png
- [x] Video iframe scaled (transform: scale(1.055)) to fill 16:9 pillarbox bars
- [x] Station `videoId` support alongside `playlistId` for single-video stations
- [x] Top-left station wired to test video for playback verification
- [x] PulseNet home button (top-left) — plays live stream, uses pulsenet_icon.png
- [x] Info button (bottom-right) — text label, shows info.png on hover, wired to `{type:'about'}`
- [x] Station buttons resized to 32×32px DOM
- [x] Button columns centred so mid-gap between items 5 and 6 aligns to video vertical centre
- [x] Station hover preview masked by frame (z-index 1, behind frame overlay)
- [x] Offline station images — `live` flag in stations.js, auto `Offline_` prefix on hover when offline
- [x] Mouse hook only active while overlay is visible — no global scroll impact when hidden
- [x] Rebrand from "PulseNet Radio" to "PulseNet Player" (binary, repo, UI, docs, lore)
- [x] v0.3.1 — video renders at natural 16:9 (812×457), no crop; frame resized to 1252×670 to fit; click-blocker bumped to 60px
- [x] v0.4.1 — outer frame bezel no longer clipped; `#app` grown 1202×646 → 1252×670, frame offset zeroed, all other elements shifted +25x/+12y, WPF constants bumped to match
- [x] v1.4.1 — OBS streaming via Window Capture (WGC). Cleared `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` from overlay so OBS lists it; F9 now parks off-screen instead of collapsing visibility so DWM keeps rendering for capture; new `AudioBridge` (WASAPI process-loopback) re-emits WebView2 audio from `PulseNet-Player.exe` so OBS Capture Audio (BETA) sees us as the audio source. New `#click-blocker-br` over YouTube fullscreen icon, `.station-col` made `pointer-events:none` to free the leftmost/rightmost ~30px of the video. "Streamer Options" panel replaced with "Streamer Info" instructions panel.
- [x] v1.4.2 — AudioCategory_Media via `IAudioClient2.SetClientProperties` so SteelSeries Sonar / Voicemeeter / Wavelink classify our session into the MEDIA channel (clean DSP) instead of GAME (degraded). AudioSessionRenamer permanently removed — diagnostic confirmed it wasn't the cause of Sonar's grouping behaviour and with AudioBridge present it would just create duplicate "PulseNet Player" entries in Volume Mixer. Streamer Info panel got the OBS Monitor Off step + the Sonar AUX-mute guidance.

## Stations

- [ ] Wire real playlist IDs for all 18 stations — set `live: true` and replace placeholder `playlistId` per station as they go live
- [x] Confirm station icons are final and correctly matched to stations
- [ ] Add `frame_glow.png` asset for glow animation layer

## Player features

- [x] Volume control — handled by the YouTube embed's own controls
- [ ] **Dedicated volume control** — tester feedback: YouTube embed controls aren't enough, users are reaching for the Windows mixer. Add an in-overlay volume slider/knob.
- [x] "Now Playing" info — track title rendered inside the YouTube embed
- [x] Shuffle — configured per station on the source YouTube channel/playlist
- [x] Loop — configured per station on the source YouTube channel/playlist

## Tester feedback (2026-04-18 beta)

- [x] **Recover from off-screen / tiny window** — tray menu now exposes "Reset window position" which restores zoom to 100%, recenters on the primary monitor, and saves. Hotkey-based reset still TBD if needed.
- [ ] **F9 toggle disappears the window when small** — pressing F9 sometimes makes it vanish entirely, especially at 20% zoom. Investigate visibility toggle interaction with very small window sizes.
- [ ] **Drag offset on high-DPI monitors** — on a 125% scaled monitor the window lands ~50px to the right of where it was dropped; works fine on a 100% monitor. DPI-awareness bug in the JS-initiated drag math.
- [x] **Click-blocker on PulseNet LIVE button** — added `#click-blocker-tl` (645×60) over the top-left of the video, neutralising YouTube's channel/title link so it can no longer spawn external browser players. Volume + settings controls (bottom-right of YouTube chrome) remain reachable.
- [ ] **Investigate F-key fullscreen toggle** — tester reports F toggles a maximized YouTube view; not reproducible on Mallachi's local setup. Confirm whether this is a YouTube embed shortcut leaking through, and decide whether to suppress it.

## Settings

- [x] Update `UpdateChecker.cs` GitHub URL — points at `Diftic/PulseNet-Player`

## Distribution

- [x] **Establish GitHub repo** — https://github.com/Diftic/PulseNet-Player
- [x] README.md — full project overview, 19-station lineup, architecture, developer guide
- [x] Sales page — `docs/index.html`, matches SC-HUD design, Coming Soon CTA, no GitHub links
- [x] **Auto-update feature** — `UpdateChecker` + `SelfUpdateService` ported from SC-HUD
- [x] GitHub Actions CI — `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds exe + MSI on `v*` tag push
- [x] WiX installer — `installer/installer.wxs`, publishes `PulseNet-Setup.msi`
- [x] Stable asset naming — `PulseNet-Player.exe` + `PulseNet-Setup.msi`
- [x] **Enable GitHub Pages** — live at https://diftic.github.io/PulseNet-Player/ (branch: master, folder: /docs)
- [ ] **External beta testing** — 60-day public beta starting 2026-04-18; bump to **v1.0.0** on/after 2026-06-17 for the stable, out-of-beta release

## Pending verification

- [ ] **Hover-to-control hotkeys on API stations** — Space, M, ←/→, ↑/↓ wired via global keyboard hook + YT IFrame API; gated on `_cursorOverVideo` (mouseenter on `#video-wrap`) and `_canForwardKeys` (API player ready, not live-stream). Not testable until a non-live playlist station is wired. Live stream (`PulseNet LIVE`) has no IFrame API surface so it intentionally falls through to the click-then-keys flow.
- [ ] **Hover-to-control on live streams** — would require either swapping the raw live-stream `<iframe>` for a `YT.Player`-wrapped equivalent, or synthesising focus/click via SendInput. Punted until base hover-to-control is verified on an API station.

## Known issues / notes

- **SteelSeries Sonar shows "MSEDGEWEBVIEW2"** — Audio is produced by WebView2 child processes (`msedgewebview2.exe`). `IAudioSessionControl::SetDisplayName` works for standard Windows mixers but Sonar reads the process executable name directly. No programmatic fix. Workaround: add a custom app entry in Sonar's mixer UI.



- `frame_glow.png` referenced in HTML but file not yet created — `onerror` hides it gracefully
- YouTube share/logo buttons can't be removed (cross-origin iframe + ToS), but `#click-blocker` (60px transparent div over the bottom of the video rect) absorbs the clicks so they can't be interacted with
- YouTube IFrame API does not fire a title-change event — `getVideoData().title` is polled every 2s while playing
- WebView2 user data shared across all virtual-host pages — auth persists across restarts
- If Renderer folder missing at runtime, overlay shows a navigation error page with helpful message
- `SelfUpdateService.ApplyMsiAsync` references `pulsenet_update` temp dir — matches naming
