## 2026-04-27 — Session 13 — v1.5.0 — Streamer Mode toggle (default off)

### The bug we shipped in v1.4.2
v1.4.2 declared the AudioBridge release "complete". The day's testing was on a streaming setup with SteelSeries Sonar; the workflow there was solid. What we missed: **AudioBridge was running unconditionally for everyone**, not just streamers. For the ~90% of users who are *just listening to music* and don't have an app router like Sonar, both audio paths (WebView2 direct + AudioBridge re-emit) hit their default device simultaneously. That's a permanent doubled-audio regression with no available fix on their end — they have no AUX channel to mute.

### The fix — make the bridge opt-in
New `StreamerModeEnabled` setting on `PulsenetSettings`, default **false**. AudioBridge's pump checks the setting in both its outer scheduling loop *and* its inner sample-pump loop, so:
- Toggle off (default): bridge sleeps; no second audio session created; non-streamers hear single-path audio just like pre-AudioBridge.
- Toggle on: bridge spins up within ~500ms (outer loop wakes from its sleep); WebView2 PID lookup, capture+render activation, sample pump all proceed as in v1.4.2.
- Toggle off mid-stream: inner pump loop notices on its next iteration (~200ms tail) and `RunOnce` returns; bridge tears its WASAPI clients down cleanly; back to single-path.

`SettingsManager.SettingsChanged` already fires synchronously on `Save`, but the pump doesn't subscribe — instead it polls the setting on each loop iteration. The thread is sleeping on either a 500ms `Thread.Sleep` (idle path) or a 200ms `WaitForSingleObject` on the capture event (active path), so the polling cost is zero and the reaction time is bounded by those waits. Cleaner than wiring a `ManualResetEvent` plus all the threading care that needs.

### UI — toggle inside Streamer Info, not in main settings
Added a checkbox row at the top of the Streamer Info sub-panel:
> **Enable streamer mode** &mdash; creates an audio bridge OBS can capture. Leave off if you're just listening to music.

Two reasons for putting it there rather than the main settings panel:
- **Discoverability inversion.** The 90% who don't stream never need to find this toggle. Hiding it inside Streamer Info means it doesn't clutter their settings.
- **Streamers always go to Streamer Info anyway** to read the OBS setup walkthrough. The toggle is the natural first step in that flow — it lives at the top of the panel, before the OBS setup steps.

The checkbox's state syncs from settings on every overlay show via `BuildSyncScript`, so it correctly reflects the persisted value across launches and across panel close/reopen.

### Sub-panel UX fixes (v1.4.2 missed these too)
Tester noticed two related glitches with Streamer Info:
1. Clicking outside the panel didn't close it (the main settings panel's click-outside handler was watching only `#settings-panel`, not `#streamer-settings-panel`).
2. Clicking the **Settings Menu** button while Streamer Info was open opened the main settings panel *behind* it, leaving both visible at once.

Fix: extended the main settings button handler to also fold `#streamer-settings-panel` (it already folds `#miniplayer-settings-panel` for the same reason), and extended the document-level click-outside handler to also close `#streamer-settings-panel` when the click lands outside it.

### Release
Tagged `v1.5.0`, pushed. Build & Release workflow publishes; v1.4.2 clients see the update banner on next launch and get a clean single-path listening experience by default.

## 2026-04-27 — Session 12 — v1.4.2 — AudioCategory, Streamer Info polish, AudioSessionRenamer rip

### What v1.4.1 missed
Session 11 shipped `AudioBridge` correctly emitting captured WebView2 audio from `PulseNet-Player.exe` so OBS Window Capture's Capture Audio (BETA) picks it up. Tester verified broadcast worked. What we discovered when running the bridge alongside SteelSeries Sonar:

1. **Sonar dumped our session into the GAME channel** because `IAudioClient` defaults to `AudioCategory_Other` and Sonar's heuristic for unclassified streams is GAME. The GAME channel applies game-oriented DSP (positional/spatial processing tuned for footsteps) which audibly mangles music — tester reported "FAR lesser audio quality".
2. **The session controls were locked** with the warning `PulseNet Player didn't allow Sonar to change the audio settings` — Sonar's UI grays the slider when classification can't be retroactively applied.
3. **Echo on the streamer's headphones**, because Sonar routes both WebView2's direct path and AudioBridge's re-emit to the listening output simultaneously with ~20–40 ms latency offset.

### Fix — declare the audio category explicitly
`IAudioClient2.SetClientProperties` with `eCategory = AudioStreamCategory.Media`, called *before* `Initialize`. Sonar then routes our session into the MEDIA channel with clean DSP, and the controls unlock.

Implementation:
- New types in `src/PInvoke/AudioBridgeInterop.cs`: `AudioStreamCategory` enum (mirrors Windows' eleven values, with `Media = 11` being the relevant one), `AudioStreamOptions` enum, `AudioClientProperties` struct, and `IAudioClient2` COM interface declared with the full IAudioClient vtable inheritance order followed by the three IAudioClient2 additions.
- `AudioBridge.RunOnce` now QIs the activated render IAudioClient to `IAudioClient2` and sets properties before `Initialize`. Capture client is left as plain IAudioClient — process-loopback capture doesn't need a category and `InitializeSharedAudioStream` doesn't accept the LOOPBACK flag anyway.
- Buffer durations dropped to `0` (auto = engine period, ~10ms) on both capture and render init for slightly tighter sync — though latency was a red herring; the dominant audible echo cause was the duplicate playback paths, not the time offset.

### The Sonar workflow
With AudioCategory in place, the architecture sorts cleanly into two visible Sonar entries:
- **MEDIA**: AudioBridge re-emit (clean processing — the audio we want streamer + viewers to hear)
- **AUX**: WebView2's helper sessions (Sonar can't classify them, defaults to AUX with degrading DSP)

Streamer mutes AUX in Sonar → only MEDIA reaches their headphones → no echo, clean quality. Sonar mutes are local-only — they don't reach OBS's WASAPI process loopback, so the broadcast continues unaffected. Streamer Info panel now documents this conditional step for users on Sonar/Voicemeeter/Wavelink.

### AudioSessionRenamer permanently removed
The pre-AudioBridge service that renamed `msedgewebview2.exe` audio sessions to "PulseNet Player" in Volume Mixer. Diagnostic test confirmed it was *not* the cause of Sonar grouping the WebView2 sessions with each other (Sonar groups by process tree, not by display name or icon). With AudioBridge providing a real `PulseNet-Player.exe` audio session, the renamer is now actively *harmful* in Volume Mixer — would create two same-named "PulseNet Player" entries side-by-side. Killed: `src/Services/AudioSessionRenamer.cs` deleted; trimmed `src/PInvoke/AudioSessionInterop.cs` from ~190 lines to ~95 lines (kept only the MMDevice + toolhelp32 interop AudioBridge needs); dropped the field + Dispose call from `App.xaml.cs`.

### Streamer Info refinements
- Added the OBS "Audio Monitoring → Monitor Off" step earlier in the session (stops OBS from also playing the captured audio back through OBS's monitor device on top of Windows' direct path).
- Added the conditional Sonar/Voicemeeter/Wavelink note about muting the AUX duplicate.

### Release
Tagged `v1.4.2`, pushed. Build & Release workflow publishes the artifacts; v1.4.1 clients see the update banner on next launch.

## 2026-04-27 — Session 11 — v1.4.1 — OBS streaming via Window Capture + WASAPI audio bridge

### The problem
Tester report: streamers can't add PulseNet to OBS unless they capture their entire desktop. Not viable — desktop capture exposes everything else on the streamer's screen (chat windows, browser tabs, etc.). They want PulseNet as a *targeted* OBS source.

Two distinct sub-problems surfaced:

1. **Window-list invisibility.** OBS's Window Capture and Game Capture pickers didn't list `PulseNet Player` at all. Investigation via `EnumWindows` + `GetWindowLongPtr(GWL_EXSTYLE)` confirmed the cause: the overlay window had `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` set, both implicitly via XAML `ShowInTaskbar="False"` (WPF auto-applies it) and explicitly in `OnSourceInitialized` "to hide from Alt+Tab". OBS filters tool windows out of its source list by design — they're meant for floating utility palettes, not main app windows. The Alt+Tab hiding goal is independently achieved by the hidden owner window WPF auto-creates from `ShowInTaskbar="False"`, so `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` was redundant for that purpose and was the single thing locking streamers out.

2. **Audio invisibility.** Even after fixing #1, OBS Window Capture's "Capture Audio (BETA)" produced silence. The captured window is owned by `PulseNet-Player.exe` but the audio sessions live entirely in `msedgewebview2.exe` helper PIDs — descendants spawned by the WebView2 runtime. Application Audio Capture didn't help either: `msedgewebview2.exe` audio sessions aren't enumerated for it on tester's machine. The `AudioSessionRenamer` already in the codebase paints over the same architectural mismatch in Volume Mixer (renames the display name to "PulseNet Player"); it doesn't move the audio's process ownership.

### The fix — pixel-mirror via Window Capture + audio re-emit

**Window discoverability** (`src/UI/OverlayWindow.xaml.cs`):
- `OnSourceInitialized` now *clears* `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` instead of setting it. Owner-window pattern still keeps the overlay out of Alt+Tab/taskbar without the flag.
- `HideOverlay` (F9 toggle) used to set `Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed`; now persists current Left/Top to settings then moves the window to `(-(FrameDisplayWidth + 100), 0)`. Window stays `Visibility.Visible`, DWM keeps compositing it, OBS WGC keeps mirroring it pixel-perfect to the broadcast — even though the streamer can no longer see it on their own monitor. F9 to show snaps it back to the saved on-screen position. This is what makes the "hide on streamer's screen / visible on stream" workflow possible: viewers never lose the player when the streamer hides it to clear their game view.

**Audio** (`src/Services/AudioBridge.cs` + `src/PInvoke/AudioBridgeInterop.cs`):
- New `IHostedService` that captures the WebView2 process tree via WASAPI process-loopback (Windows 10 v2004+ API) and re-emits the audio from `PulseNet-Player.exe` itself, so OBS's process-bound Capture Audio (BETA) sees us as the audio-producing process.
- Activation path: `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync(VAD\Process_Loopback, IAudioClient, PROPVARIANT(VT_BLOB → AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_PARAMS{PROCESS_LOOPBACK, target=webView2RootPid, INCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE}))`. The `INCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE` flag follows WebView2's helper renderer/audio children dynamically so we don't need to chase individual PIDs as they spawn and die.
- Capture init reuses the render endpoint's mix format (`IAudioClient.GetMixFormat`), so no resampling happens in the pump path. Tester's machine is in 8-channel 96 kHz 32-bit shared-mode rendering and the bridge handles it without conversion.
- Pump runs on a background thread bumped to MMCSS "Pro Audio" priority via `AvSetMmThreadCharacteristicsW`. Event-driven via `IAudioClient.SetEventHandle` + `WaitForSingleObject`; drains all available capture packets per wake and copies straight into render buffer slots. Capture release happens unconditionally after every read so transient render stalls drop frames rather than blocking the pipeline.
- Trade-off accepted: the streamer hears doubled audio locally (WebView2's direct path + our re-emit). They manage that via OBS per-source audio monitoring controls — viewers receive the clean re-emit only.

### Click-blocker tightening
While the player was now stream-capturable, a few YouTube-chrome leaks became more visible since the broadcast preserves them pixel-for-pixel:
- New `#click-blocker-br` (80×50 at `right:0; bottom:83px`) over the fullscreen-expand icon YouTube overlays in the bottom-right of embedded videos.
- `#click-blocker` height bumped 60→62 to fully clear hover affordances.
- `.station-col` got `pointer-events: none` — the column container boxes were swallowing clicks in the leftmost ~37px and rightmost ~39px of the video rect because they overlap the video horizontally. The buttons inside still set `pointer-events: auto` so they remain clickable.

### Settings panel
"Streamer Options" (which configured the now-removed Browser Source server) became "Streamer Info": a static instructional sub-panel walking through OBS setup — Window Capture, capture method = Windows 10 (1903 and up), Capture Audio (BETA) on, Capture Cursor off, Client Area on, F9 hint. The panel ID stayed `streamer-settings-panel` for backward compatibility with `BuildSyncScript`'s panel-reset logic.

### Dead code removed
The Browser Source approach (built in an earlier draft of this session before the Window Capture pivot) is gone:
- Deleted `src/Services/BrowserSourceServer.cs` (HTTP listener + SSE infrastructure for `/banner`, `/player`, `/events`)
- Deleted `src/Services/NowPlayingState.cs` (was only an SSE broker between overlay and the server; reverted to direct `overlay → banner` event wiring in `App.xaml.cs`)
- Deleted `src/Renderer/obs/{player.html,player.css,player.js}` (the OBS-tailored variants)
- Removed `BrowserSourcePort` from `PulsenetSettings`, `BrowserSourceDefaultPort`/`BrowserSourceLoopback`/`BrowserSourceObsFolder`/`PulsenetBroadcastChannelId` from `Constants`, the `browserSourcePort` and `playerState` web-message handlers from `OverlayWindow`, the `__pulsenetSetStreamerState` JS hook + Streamer Options handlers from `Renderer/player.js`, and the `.streamer-url-input`/`.streamer-status`/`.streamer-copy-btn` CSS rules
- Net delta from the Browser Source experiment: ~600 lines removed across 10 files

### Version bump
`v0.4.1 → v1.4.1`. Major bump because the streamer-facing capability is fundamentally new: PulseNet Player is now usable as an OBS source out of the box, both visually (Window Capture) and audibly (process-loopback bridge). Same workflow that previously required Display Capture (with all its privacy trade-offs) now works with a targeted Window Capture source. This is the feature that makes PulseNet viable for its second, non-music use case too — visual cover for stream-sniper-sensitive game info on the broadcast.

### Release
Tagged `v1.4.1`, pushed. Build & Release workflow publishes `PulseNet-Player.exe` + `PulseNet-Setup.msi` to the GitHub release page; v0.4.x clients see the update banner on next launch.

## 2026-04-22 — Session 10 — v0.4.1 — Full outer frame bezel no longer clipped

### The bug
Session 6 (v0.3.1) had resized the frame PNG to 1252×670 and placed it at offset `(-25, -12)` inside a 1202×646 `#app` container with `overflow: hidden`, accepting the overhang clip as a visual tradeoff. Turned out the overhang wasn't empty bezel — it contained the frame's rounded corners, outer bolts, and glow tips. All four outer edges were being shaved 25px horizontally and 12px vertically, visible in tester screenshots.

### The fix (option 1 — code-only, asset untouched)
Grew the canvas to match the art instead of trimming the art to match the canvas:
- `src/Renderer/style.css`: `#app` 1202×646 → 1252×670. `#frame-base` and `#frame-glow` offsets `(-25,-12)` → `(0,0)` — no more overhang, no more clipping. Every other absolutely-positioned element shifted `+25x, +12y` to sit at the same spot relative to the frame: `#video-wrap` and `#station-preview` `(193,88)` → `(218,100)`; `.station-col` base top `80` → `92`; `#stations-left` `(37,129)` → `(62,141)`; `#stations-right` left `966` → `991`; `#pulsenet-home-btn` `(118,80)` → `(143,92)`; `#about-btn` `(1049,521)` → `(1074,533)`; `#settings-btn` `(507,581)` → `(532,593)` (still centred — 626 = 1252/2); both settings panels left `348` → `373`, bottom `62` → `74`.
- `src/Constants.cs`: `FrameDisplayWidth/Height` `1202/646` → `1252/670` so the WPF window and WebView2 viewport grow to match. Consumed by `App.xaml.cs` (off-screen banner-parking offset) and `OverlayWindow.ApplyZoom` (window resize + `WebView.ZoomFactor` scaling) — no other call sites, so the bump propagates automatically. Saved window positions in `settings.json` remain valid (position is x/y, not size).

### Dev-loop gotcha
`<Platform>x64</Platform>` in the csproj makes `dotnet build` write to `bin/x64/Debug/net9.0-windows/` by default, but an older v0.3.1 artefact from Apr 18 was still living at that path and auto-starting at login. `dotnet run --no-build` hit the mutex (`Constants.MutexId`) and silently exited, so the on-screen window kept being the stale v0.3.1 build (which is why its splash correctly reported "v0.4.0 available"). Resolution: `taskkill` the zombie, `dotnet build -a x64` (lands in the RID-qualified `bin/x64/Debug/net9.0-windows/win-x64/` subdir), launch that exe directly. Not a code issue — worth noting for the next time someone wonders why changes don't take.

### Release
Tagged `v0.4.1`, pushed. Build & Release workflow publishes `PulseNet-Player.exe` + `PulseNet-Setup.msi` to the GitHub release page; clients at v0.4.0 will see the banner on next launch.

## 2026-04-18 — Session 9 — v0.4.0 — Mini banner + Miniplayer Settings

### Minimise to banner
New tri-state window lifecycle for overlay + banner: `Hidden ↔ Banner ↔ Full`. Added `MinimizeMode` setting (`Banner` default, `Tray` opt-in) selectable in the main settings panel. Hotkey cycles Full ↔ Banner in banner mode, Full ↔ Hidden in tray mode. `MiniBannerWindow` is a separate WPF + WebView2 window, `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` + `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, alpha=1/255 background (so OS hit-testing still functions when WS_EX_TRANSPARENT is cleared in edit mode), sharing the Renderer virtual host but with its own WebView2 cache folder (`WebView2BannerCache`) because the overlay env uses `--disk-cache-size=0` and mismatched options on the same userDataFolder silently fails `CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync`.

### Banner content
Three rows served from `banner.html` via `PostWebMessageAsJson`: station label (pushed on `activateStation` / home-button click), track title (polled by player.js and pushed on change, hidden when empty), and hotkey hint (seeded from `ToggleHotkey`, re-synced on settings change). Home-button label is `Pulse Broadcasting Network - LIVE Music`.

### Miniplayer Settings sub-panel
New button in the main settings menu (between Lock and Minimize-mode rows) opens a sub-panel that takes the same anchor as the main panel. While open the banner enters edit mode: `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` is cleared (and `SWP_FRAMECHANGED` forced so the style change actually takes effect), so clicks reach the banner. Sub-panel exposes: banner lock toggle (independent of main overlay lock), banner opacity slider (20–100% applied via body opacity), scale control (20–120% default 100, drives both window Width/Height and `WebView.ZoomFactor` so content scales with the frame), and a `Reset to centre` button that re-centres on the working area.

### Drag implementation
The obvious `WndProc` → `WM_NCHITTEST` → `HTCAPTION` trick doesn't work because the WebView2 child HWND intercepts mouse events before the parent's WndProc sees the hit-test. Instead, `banner.js` posts `bannerDragStart` on left-mousedown, and the host calls `ReleaseCapture` + `SendMessage(WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN, HTCAPTION)` to kick off Windows' native modal drag loop. Drop position persists through `LocationChanged` (with a suppression flag around programmatic moves like off-screen parking and `ShowBanner`'s snap-to-anchor).

### Settings shape
New fields on `PulsenetSettings`: `MinimizeMode`, `BannerLocked`, `BannerOpacity`, `BannerScalePct`, `BannerLeft`, `BannerTop`. Tray reset (session 7) already lands the overlay back to 100% zoom; banner `Reset to centre` does the equivalent for the banner independently.

---

## 2026-04-18 — Session 8 — Hover-to-control hotkey forwarder (pinned)

### What's wired
Global low-level keyboard hook (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) installed on overlay show. Allow-list: Space, K (play/pause), M (mute), ←/→ (seek ±5s), ↑/↓ (volume ±5). When intercepted, key is swallowed at OS level and `window.__pulsenetForwardKey(action)` is invoked via `ExecuteScriptAsync`; the renderer drives the YouTube IFrame API directly (`pauseVideo`, `seekTo`, `setVolume`, `mute`, etc.). Auto-repeat suppressed via a `_hoverKeysDown` HashSet so holding a key fires once per press.

### Two gates
1. `_cursorOverVideo` — JS-pushed via `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` on `#video-wrap` (kept in JS to avoid C#-side DPI/zoom math; an earlier physical-px rect computation broke at 125% DPI).
2. `_canForwardKeys` — JS-pushed whenever the player mode changes (`onReady`, `teardownPlayer`, `loadLiveStream`). True only when the API player is ready and live-stream mode is off. Without this gate the hook would swallow keys it can't actually forward, which previously broke the original click-then-keys flow.

### Pinned: live-stream limitation
The `PulseNet LIVE` button uses a raw `<iframe>` pointed at `youtube.com/embed/live_stream?channel=…` (the IFrame API can't pin to a live stream because the `videoId` rotates per restart). With no API surface, `_canForwardKeys` stays false on live mode and the hook falls through, preserving YouTube's native click-then-keys behaviour. Hover-to-control on live streams would need either a `YT.Player` wrapping of the live iframe (with periodic re-resolution of the current `videoId`) or a SendInput-based focus/click simulation. Both are intrusive enough to defer until the first playlist-backed station goes live and the API path can actually be exercised.

## 2026-04-18 — Session 7 — Tray reset, min zoom 30%, button rows shifted, top-left click-blocker

### Min zoom raised 20% → 30%
Below 30% the frame graphics break down visually. Clamp updated in three places: `OverlayWindow.ApplyZoom` (authoritative; also rescues stale `settings.json` values <30), `index.html` `#zoom-input` `min`, and `player.js` `sendZoom` floor.

### Button columns shifted 10px outward
After the background-graphics widening, both station columns sat too close to the video. Shifted `#stations-left` 47→37, `#stations-right` 956→966; companion home/about buttons updated to keep their column-center alignment (128→118, 1039→1049). Comments updated with new center math.

### Top-left click-blocker (`#click-blocker-tl`)
New 645×60 transparent absorber added inside `#video-wrap`, anchored at (0,0), z-index 3 — same pattern as the existing bottom blocker. Neutralises YouTube's channel-name / title-link in the upper-left of the player chrome, which was spawning external browser windows that kept streaming after close (tester feedback #4). Width tuned iteratively (150→220→600→630→645) to reach the right edge of the YouTube title text without covering the playback toggle / volume / settings controls on the bottom-right.

---

## 2026-04-18 — Session 7 — Tray "Reset window position"

### Recovery from broken window state
Beta tester reported resizing the overlay to 20% pushed it off the visible area, with the only recovery path being hand-editing `settings.json`. Added a `ResetWindowRequested` event + "Reset Player Window" menu item to `TrayIcon`. `OverlayWindow.ResetWindow()` reapplies 100% zoom (which also resizes Width/Height to the full frame canvas), recenters on the primary monitor via the existing `CenterOnScreen()` helper, persists the new position + zoom through `SettingsManager`, and ensures the overlay is visible. Wired in `App.xaml.cs` directly to the singleton overlay reference. Menu order is now: Retry update (conditional), Reset Player Window, Exit.

`ApplyZoom` only updates C# state — the renderer's settings-panel `#zoom-input` field is normally synced on `ShowOverlay` via `BuildSyncScript`. A reset triggered while the overlay is already visible left the displayed value stale, so `ResetWindow()` explicitly re-runs `BuildSyncScript` after the zoom change.

---

## 2026-04-18 — Session 6 — v0.3.1 — Natural video resolution + frame refit

### Video at natural 16:9, no crop
Prior versions used `transform: scale(1.055)` on the YouTube iframe to fill the 812×433 video container's pillarbox bars (container was 1.875:1, not true 16:9). The fill was cosmetic but chopped ~12px off the top and bottom of actual video content. Removed the scale transform entirely. Reshaped `#video-wrap` and `#station-preview` to 812×457 (true 16:9), vertically recentered at y=316.5 so all station button positions remain valid without recalculation.

### Frame refit: 1252×670
With the video rect now taller, the previous frame size (1222×656, offset -10/-5) was too small — the cutout clipped the expanded video. Scaled the frame PNG display to 1252×670 with offset (-25, -12) so the cutout aligns with the new 812×457 video area. Frame art is slightly non-uniformly stretched (1.041× wide, 1.037× tall relative to its native 1202×646 canvas ratio); not visually noticeable.

### Click-blocker — 50px → 60px
YouTube's end-card / share overlay extends slightly higher than the previous 50px absorber reached. Bumped `#click-blocker` height to 60px so the full bottom control strip is neutralised.

### Docs
README Installation section rewritten to describe both `PulseNet-Setup.msi` (per-user installer, recommended) and `PulseNet-Player.exe` (standalone launcher). Roadmap updated — auto-update, CI, and WiX installer now ticked off; remaining roadmap is volume control, Now Playing tooltip, Info dialog, and real playlist IDs.

### Release
Tagged `v0.3.1`, pushed. Build & Release workflow publishes both artifacts to the GitHub release page.

## 2026-04-17 — Session 5 — v0.3.0 — Discord CTA, click-blocker, tray icon cleanup

### Discord button in settings panel
Earlier iterations placed a "Join us on Discord" button above and then overlaying the video. Neither position felt right — centered above fought with the video centerline, and bottom-right overlayed YouTube's own controls. Solution: embedded the Discord wordmark button inside the settings panel, above the frame-lock row. Uses the existing `.settings-action-btn` class for identical dimensions (452×40), with the logo filling the button edge-to-edge via `object-fit: contain`. Clicks route through the existing `openUrl` WebView message → `OpenInDefaultBrowser`, opening <https://discord.com/invite/Vxn7kzzWGJ> in the user's default browser. Logo source (2260×200) resized to 904×80 (2x HiDPI) for crisp display.

### Click-blocker — YouTube overlay neutralised
Added a transparent `#click-blocker` div inside `#video-wrap`, positioned to cover the bottom 50px of the video rect (full width × 50px). No listeners, no visual feedback — just absorbs clicks so the user can't reach YouTube's "More videos" / "Share" / fullscreen overlay at the bottom. `z-index: 3` puts it above the iframe but below frame/stations/settings.

### Tray icon — dropped active-state green tint
`TrayIcon.cs` previously applied a 140-alpha green overlay (`Color.FromArgb(80, 200, 120)`) to signal "player open". Clashed with the brand cyan. Removed `_iconActive` + `TintIcon` helper + `SetActive` method entirely; removed the `OverlayShown`/`OverlayHidden` event subscriptions from `App.xaml.cs` that fed it. Tray icon now stays blue regardless of state.

### 1px video-frame gap fixed
`#video-wrap` and `#station-preview` had `top: 101px` (off by one from the file's header spec of `top=100`), producing a visible gap between the top of the video and the sci-fi frame overlay graphic. Reset to `top: 100px` to match the frame's video cutout.

---

## 2026-04-17 — Session 4 — README, sales page, station count correction

### README.md
Comprehensive project README written covering: project overview and lore, features list, requirements, installation, usage table, full 19-station lineup (both columns), architecture overview, adding stations / going live guide, roadmap, and build-from-source instructions.

### Sales page (docs/index.html)
Landing page built matching the SC-HUD design language — dark space theme, cyan accent, star field hero, animated "Coming Soon" badge. Sections: hero with screenshot, stats bar, features grid, full station lineup table, how-it-works steps, settings reference, notes, lore banner, CTA. GitHub references intentionally excluded (no download links, no repo links).

### Promotional screenshot
`src/Assets/PulseNet Player.png` added — used as the hero image in both the README (`docs/preview.png`) and the sales page.

### Station count corrected to 19
**PulseNet LIVE** (the home button, top-left) is the 19th station — plays all channels indiscriminately. Each column has 10 buttons (left: PulseNet LIVE + 9 stations; right: 9 stations + Info). All references updated across README, sales page, and station descriptions.

### SteelSeries Sonar audio session rename — investigated, not achievable
Attempted to rename the WebView2 audio session via `IAudioSessionControl::SetDisplayName` (CoreAudio COM interop) so Sonar would show "PulseNet Player" instead of "MSEDGEWEBVIEW2". Implementation was correct and works for standard Windows audio mixers (EarTrumpet, Windows Volume Mixer), but SteelSeries Sonar reads the process executable name directly and ignores the session display name. Root cause: audio is produced by `msedgewebview2.exe` child processes spawned by WebView2 — this is true regardless of how the host executable is named. No programmatic fix is possible. Code reverted cleanly.

---

## 2026-04-16 — Session 3 — Special buttons, offline states, mouse hook fix

### Special utility buttons
Two new buttons added outside the station columns:
- **PulseNet home button** (top-left): uses `pulsenet_icon.png`, plays the live stream `videoId: 'b-YcZMSKqeo'` directly in the player. Link moved here from l1 (Alternative Routes), which reverts to a standard playlist station.
- **Info button** (bottom-right): text-only ("Info", 8px Consolas), shows `info.png` on hover. Sends `{type:'about'}` to C# on click for future wiring.

### Button sizing and column alignment
- Station buttons reduced from 38×38px to 32×32px DOM (renders ~39×39px with scale 1.23).
- Columns re-centred: mid-gap between items 5 and 6 (counting special buttons as part of the column) aligned to video vertical centre (y=316.5px).
  - Left col: `top: 129px` (home button counts as item 1, stations as 2–10)
  - Right col: `top: 80px` (stations 1–9, info button as item 10)
  - Special buttons spaced one gap (17px) from the nearest station button.

### Station hover preview masked by frame
`#station-preview` z-index lowered from 4 → 1, placing it behind the frame overlay. Previously it rendered above the frame and bled outside the cutout. Now it's masked by the frame the same way the idle logo and video are.

### Offline station images
- `live` flag added to every station entry in `stations.js` (all currently `false`).
- Hover preview auto-derives `Offline_<filename>` path when `live: false`; uses regular icon when `live: true`.
- All 18 `Offline_` images created, deployed to `Renderer/assets/stations/`.
- To bring a station live: set `live: true` and replace the placeholder `playlistId`.

### Mouse hook — no longer blocks system scroll when overlay hidden
`WH_MOUSE_LL` was installed at app startup and ran for the entire process lifetime, adding latency to all mouse events globally even when the overlay was hidden. Refactored: hook is now installed in `ShowOverlay()` and uninstalled in `HideOverlay()`. Zero system-wide impact when the overlay is off.

### Minor layout tweaks
- Video window and preview rect shifted down 1px (`top: 101px`) for better frame alignment.
- Settings Menu button moved up 5px (`top: 581px`).

## 2026-04-14 — Session 2 — UI polish, drag overhaul, zoom, channel wired

### Drag system rebuilt (WH_MOUSE_LL → JS-initiated)
Previous drag implementation used a geometric exclusion zone in the C# hook to decide what was draggable. This broke at non-100% zoom because CSS zoom scaled visuals but not the WPF window, causing coordinate mismatches. Full rewrite:

- **JS is authoritative:** `mousedown` listener walks the DOM — if the click is not on a button, input, video area, or settings panel, it sends `{type:'startDrag'}` to C#.
- **C# hook tracks last cursor position** (volatile fields) so it can reconstruct the drag origin when the JS message arrives.
- **WH_MOUSE_LL handles MOUSEMOVE and LBUTTONUP** — moves window via `SetWindowPos(SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS)`, syncs WPF `Left`/`Top` on release.
- Result: entire frame is draggable except buttons, video area, and settings panel. Works correctly at all zoom levels.

### Zoom: window resizes with content
`ApplyZoom` now resizes the WPF window proportionally (`Width = FrameDisplayWidth * factor`, `Height = FrameDisplayHeight * factor`) and sets `WebView.ZoomFactor` in the same call. Previously CSS `zoom` was used, which caused blink and coordinate mismatches. Zoom range: 20–100%.

### Zoom controls replaced
Zoom slider removed. Replaced with: `-10% size` button · number input (20–100) · `+10% size` button. Eliminates blink issues the slider had.

### Settings panel doubled
Font sizes doubled (8→16px), panel width 250→500px, button heights 20→40px, border-radius 6→12px.

### Window position persistence
`HideOverlay` saves `WindowLeft`/`WindowTop` to settings. `ShowOverlay` restores them, falls back to center on first run.

### Idle logo
`main_logo.png` shown in video area when no station is active. Hidden when a station button is clicked. Restored on playlist end with no active station.

### Splash screen
Logo updated to `main_logo.png` (Pulsenet branding), resized to 225×225px. Layout anchored top with reduced margins so all content is visible.

### Scroll wheel fix
WH_MOUSE_LL scroll hook now checks if cursor is inside the overlay window rect before consuming the event. Previously captured scroll globally whenever the overlay was visible.

### Frame width trim
Frame width reduced from 1258px to 1202px (28px each side trimmed) to better fit the frame_base.png visual. All CSS x-coordinates and `Constants.FrameDisplayWidth` updated accordingly. Video area (812×433) unchanged.

### Video fill
YouTube iframe scaled via `transform: scale(1.055)` to fill pillarbox bars caused by the 812×433 container being wider than 16:9.

### Station playback
- `stations.js` updated: `videoId` property supported alongside `playlistId` for single-video stations.
- Top-left station (Alternative Routes) wired to test video `b-YcZMSKqeo`.
- All 18 station playlist IDs updated to real Pulsenet channel (`UCIMaIJsfJEMi5yJIe5nAb0g` → uploads playlist `UUIMaIJsfJEMi5yJIe5nAb0g`).
- Default `YoutubeChannelId` in settings updated to `UCIMaIJsfJEMi5yJIe5nAb0g`.

### Assets
- `icon.ico` replaced with Pulsenet branding — multi-resolution (16, 32, 48, 256px) generated from `PulseNetIcon 1024x1024.png`.
- `main_logo.png` replaced with resized (812×433) Pulsenet logo for idle state.
- Stale `logo.png` resource entry removed from `pulsenet.csproj`.

## 2026-04-14 — Modules 0-2 — Sci-fi frame overlay rebuild

**Architecture decision: stay WPF, not Python rewrite.**
The PulseNetPlan.md proposal to rewrite in PyQt6 was discarded, no technical justification, WebView2 is more reliable than QWebEngineView on Windows for YouTube, and the existing WPF infrastructure was already proven.

### Frame asset
- Source image: `src/Assets/pulsenet_background.png`, 2515×1292, transparent outside frame
- Video area cut to fully transparent by user
- Displayed at 50% → **1258×646** window (since trimmed to 1202×646)
- Video rect within display: `left=193 top=100 width=812 height=433`

### Renderer rebuild (everything visual lives in HTML/CSS/JS)
WPF airspace problem (WebView2 HWND always renders above WPF visuals) means the frame and buttons cannot be WPF elements. Solution: put everything in the renderer.

Layer stack (z-index):
1. YouTube iframe — `video-wrap` at video rect
2. `frame_base.png` — structural frame, `pointer-events:none`
3. `frame_glow.png` — glow overlay, CSS pulse animation, hidden until asset exists
4. Station buttons — `pointer-events:auto`, inside frame panel areas

### Station buttons
- 18 buttons: 9 left column + 9 right column
- Icon-based; hover shows full station icon preview over video area
- Defined in `Renderer/stations.js`
- Active button gets cyan glow border

### Window
- Fixed size: `Constants.FrameDisplayWidth × FrameDisplayHeight` (currently 1202×646)
- Centered on primary screen on first show; position persisted after that
- Drag handled via JS `startDrag` → C# WH_MOUSE_LL hook

## 2026-03-30 — v0.1.0 — Initial project setup

**Cloned from SC-HUD** and transitioned into a standalone YouTube overlay player.

### Architecture decisions

**Virtual host instead of `file://`**
YouTube IFrame API requires the host page to be served over HTTPS. WebView2's `SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping` maps `https://pulsenet.local/` to the local `Renderer/` folder, satisfying this requirement without a real server.

**Channel ID via URL query param**
The C# side navigates to `https://pulsenet.local/index.html?channelId=UCxxxxxx`. The JS reads `URLSearchParams` on load. When the user changes the channel ID in Settings, the app re-navigates with the new param.

**Uploads playlist auto-derivation**
Every YouTube channel has an auto-generated uploads playlist with ID `UU` + `channelId[2:]` (swap the `UC` prefix).

**OAuth/sign-in via existing popup mechanism**
Any `window.open()` from within the iframe goes through `OnNewWindowRequested`, which opens a shared-environment WebView2 popup. Auth cookies persist in `%APPDATA%\pulsenet-radio\WebView2Cache`.

### What was stripped from SC-HUD

| Removed | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `ScAnchorService.cs` | SC-specific — no game to anchor to |
| `OverlayUrl` setting | Replaced by `YoutubeChannelId` |
| Environment toggle (Ctrl+Shift+D) | Was a prod/staging scbridge.app switcher |
| SC-specific error messages | Irrelevant |
